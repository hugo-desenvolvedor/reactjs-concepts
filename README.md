# ReactJS concepts
Initial project with ReactJs concepts to GoStack Boot Camp course.
In this project, we need to handle with the backend created in [NodeJS Concepts](https://github.com/hugo-desenvolvedor/nodejs-concepts).

## Running tests
* Executing all tests, just run
```
    yarn test // or npm run test
```
* Executing specific test, run `yarn test-name` and the test name:
```
    npm jest -t 'should be able to add new repository'
```
* All the suit test cases are in `\src\__tests__`
